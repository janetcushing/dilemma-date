# dilemma-date
Date Night Dilemma is an application which will provide a suggested movie and dinner date plan.

The application was designed and developed by Janet Cushing, Adam Magee, Michelle Baumann and Michael Fessendon.

This application takes in criteria such as your zip code, a radius, a date and time, a movie genre and a dinner cuisine type.  It uses this info to call 3 APIs, and returns a dinner and movie date suggestion in your neighborhood based on the zip code and radius that you enter.  It also returns an entertaining "romance rating" along with the dinner and movie suggestion.

The APIs that it uses are Zomato, Rotten Tomatoes and Google places.

There is a settings tab, where you can put defaults for your searches, and it will store them and prepopulate the input fields the next time you log in to the app.

The application will also show you other people's queries, so you can see the searches that your friends and neighbors are making also.

On the results page, there is a 'retry' button.  The results are brought back using a randomizing function.  If you don't like the suggested date, you can hit the retry button and it will bring back a different suggestion from the randomized selections.
